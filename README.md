Title: Hodlerboard: Token Lockup Leaderboard Game

Summary:
The Token Lockup Leaderboard Game is a blockchain-based platform that incentivizes users to lock up their ERC20 tokens for a specified period of time. The game is built around a smart contract that tracks deposits, lockup periods, and early withdrawals. By participating, users can earn additional tokens based on the penalties incurred by those who withdraw early. 

Key Features:
1. Users deposit a fixed amount of ERC20 tokens and choose a lockup period in block time.
2. The smart contract tracks the lockup duration for each user and ranks them on a leaderboard.
3. Users who withdraw early incur a penalty (e.g., 50% of their deposit), which is then redistributed among the remaining participants.
4. Penalties are distributed daily, proportionate to the remaining lockup time of the active participants.
5. The leaderboard is updated in real-time, providing a competitive and engaging experience for users.

Benefits:
- Encourages users to hold onto their tokens for a longer period, supporting token value stability.
- Offers an engaging and competitive experience for users, fostering community engagement.
- Provides a transparent and decentralized platform for tracking token lockup periods and rewards.
- Increases liquidity for the token ecosystem by penalizing early withdrawals.

The Token Lockup Leaderboard Game offers a unique and engaging way for users to interact with their ERC20 tokens, while simultaneously promoting long-term holding and community involvement.
